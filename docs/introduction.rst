Introduction
============

pygeofilter is a pure python parser of the Common Query Language (CQL) defined in the
`OGC Catalogue specification <https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-168r6/12-168r6.html>`_.

The basic bare-bone functionality is to parse the given CQL to an abstract
syntax tree (AST) representation. This AST can then be used to create filters
for databases or search engines.
